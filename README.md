# 8331project
**********************
* This is a song recommender system implementation via R codes.
* Two recommendation algorithms(User-based Collabprative Filtering & Content-based Filtering) have been implemented.
* Raw data, Million Song Subset, can be find here: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-simple-song-recommender-296fcbc8c85
* Reference codes is coming from Kavya Beheraj and Jeremy O’Brien’s coding sample: https://rpubs.com/ksb357/388973
* This project has also compared the predicting performance (RMSE) on large-scale dataset of the two algorithms.
* The recommendation results are shown as tables and charts.
